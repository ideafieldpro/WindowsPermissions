# Windows Permissions Management

## Objective

The Windows permissions management project aimed to provide practical experience in managing and configuring file and folder permissions in a Windows environment. The primary focus was to understand the concepts of access control, user rights, and how to effectively implement security measures to protect sensitive data.

### Skills Learned

- In-depth understanding of Windows file and folder permission models.
- Ability to configure NTFS permissions for users and groups.
- Knowledge of inheritance and how it affects permissions.
- Skills in troubleshooting access issues and applying the principle of least privilege.
- Enhanced ability to secure data through effective permission management.

### Tools Used

- Windows operating system for hands-on lab exercises.
- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) for managing user permissions.

## Steps

### 1. Set Up the Lab Environment

- Configured a virtual machine running Windows Server for permission management tasks.


### 2. Create User Accounts and Groups

- Established user accounts and groups to simulate a real-world environment.


### 3. Configure NTFS Permissions

- Applied various NTFS permissions on folders and files, including Full Control, Modify, Read & Execute, and Deny permissions.
